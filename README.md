C# & C++ Video Capture Application

Overview
This project is a video capture application built with a C# GUI that interacts with a C++ DLL to handle video capture and rendering. The application allows users to capture video from either a webcam or a video file, and displays the video frames in a GUI window. The video processing is done using MediaLooks SDK for capturing and OpenCV for rendering, while the C# application provides the user interface.

Features
Start Capture From WebCam: Captures live video from an available webcam.
Start Capture From File: Loads a video file and loops the playback from the first frame once the video ends.
Stop: Stops the video capture process.
Real-Time Video Rendering: Video frames are drawn onto the window generated by the C# form, but the drawing is handled in the C++ layer using OpenCV.
Project Structure
The project is divided into two parts:

C#: Implements the graphical user interface (GUI) and delegates video capture tasks to the C++ DLL.
C++: Handles video capture from either a webcam or video file using the MediaLooks SDK, and renders each frame using OpenCV.
C# Part
Implements the Windows Forms application with three buttons:
Start Capture From WebCam
Start Capture From File
Stop
Generates the window where the video frames are displayed (rendered by the C++ code).
C++ Part
Uses MediaLooks SDK to capture video from either a webcam or file.
Uses OpenCV to draw the video frames onto the GUI window created by the C# form.
